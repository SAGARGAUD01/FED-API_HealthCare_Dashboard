## Project Overview
In this project, you will convert an Adobe XD template into HTML and integrate it with the Coalition Technologies Patient Data API to dynamically populate the UI. The focus will be on creating a static HTML page that fetches and displays patient data through API calls.

## Instructions
1. Adobe XD Template Conversion
Convert the provided Adobe XD template into HTML.
The Adobe XD template can be found here.
2. Fetch and Display Data using API
Use the Coalition Technologies Patient Data API to fetch patient information.
API documentation can be found here.
Populate the UI with the fetched data.
3. Display Data for Specific Patient
Only display information for Jessica Taylor.
No additional points will be awarded for displaying data of other patients.
4. Graph Implementation
Implement a graph to display the blood pressure of patients each year.
Recommended library: Chart.js.
Feel free to use any other chart or graph library if preferred.
5. Frameworks
You may use frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue.js, etc.
Ensure to include the HTML file for review.
6. Avoid Unnecessary Interactions
Do not spend time on UI interactions that are not present in the template.
Examples:
Logic and interaction of the search button.
Dropdown for the gear icon.
Interaction with ellipses (...) in the side navigation.
